![](/images/LP-2019.jpg)

I am a software engineer in Sydney.

I am very interested in functional programming (FP).
In my day job, I use FP in Scala.
Outside of work hours, I like to play with Haskell as well as Scala.
I would like to play with Haskell during work hours too, but it hasn't happened yet.

Javascript is right out.

This blog is a record of the occasional thing that catches my interest, however briefly.
Articles are not necessarily aimed at the beginner.
They are more a record of thoughts and learnings that might interest other engineers in this field.

You might also be interested in my [photography website](http://www.leighperry.com/).
Photography and playing the acoustic guitar give me alternative creative outlets to the
also-creative outlet of software engineering.
