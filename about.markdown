![](/images/LP-2019.jpg)

I am a software engineer in Sydney, Australia.
I am currently very interested in functional programming.
In my day job, I use FP in Scala.

Outside of work hours, I like to play with Haskell as well as Scala.
I would like to play with Haskell during work hours too, but it hasn't happened yet.

Kotlin is right out.

This blog is a record of the occasional thing that catches my interest, however briefly.
